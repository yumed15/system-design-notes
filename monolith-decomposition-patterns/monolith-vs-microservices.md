# Monolith vs Microservices

**Monolith:**

* a change in one of the modules can only be brought into production by bringing a new version of the entire application

**Microservices:**

* &#x20;independently deployable modules
* eases the **scalability of development**
* minimizes the team coordination effort required for large projects
* easier to maintain or replace a microservice
