Microservices have been getting more and more popular in recent years, and several companies are migrating monolithic applications to microservices. But just a reminder that switching to microservices might not always be the good option. Martin Fowler wrote a nice article regarding the [monolith-first approach](http://bit.ly/2jclLet). Here are a couple of useful statements:

* _Almost all the successful microservice stories have started with a monolith that grew too big and was broken up._
* _Almost all the cases Iâ€™ve heard of a system that was built as a microservice system from scratch, it has ended up in serious trouble._
