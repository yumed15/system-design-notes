# Proxies

_= piece of software or hardware that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers_.

* used to filter requests, log requests, or sometimes transform requests. Its cache can serve a lot of requests (If multiple clients access a particular resource, the proxy server can cache it and serve it to all the clients without going to the remote server.)
