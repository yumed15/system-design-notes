# Key Characteristics of Distributed Systems

_= a set of loosely-coupled components that can be deployed and scaled independently called services._

* **Stability** or **Serviceability** or **Manageability** = s_implicity and speed with which a system can be repaired or maintained._
* **Reliability** _= probability a system will fail in a given period_. A distributed system is considered reliable if it keeps delivering its services even when one or several of its software or hardware components fail.
* **Scalability** _=_ _capability of a system, process, or a network to grow and manage increased demand._
* **Efficiency/Performance** = _response time_ (or latency = delay to obtain the first item) + _throughput_ (or bandwidth = the number of items delivered in a given time unit)
* **Availability** = _simple measure of the percentage of time that a system, service, or a machine remains operational under normal conditions._
* **Fault tolerance** and **Catastrophe-preparedness**
