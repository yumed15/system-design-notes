# Transactional outbox

_= design pattern used in used in distributed systems and microservices architectures where messages need to be sent to external systems (e.g., message queues, other services) as part of a database transaction. The goal is to guarantee that messages are sent if and only if the database transaction is successfully committed._



### Transactional Outbox Flow

1. **Outbox Table**: In your application's database, you create an "outbox" table to store messages that need to be sent to external systems. This table typically includes columns for message content, destination, status (unsent, sent, failed, etc.), and a unique identifier.
2. **Within a Transaction**: When your application needs to send a message as part of a business operation (e.g., creating an order, updating user information), it inserts a message record into the outbox table within the same database transaction.
3. **Transactional Consistency**: This insertion into the outbox table is done as part of the larger database transaction. This ensures that the message and the associated data changes are either both committed or both rolled back in a transactionally consistent manner.
4. **Message Processing Service**: Separately, you have a message processing service or component that periodically polls the outbox table for unsent messages. This component is responsible for sending the messages to their intended destinations, such as message queues, external services, or other microservices.
5. **Marking as Sent**: Once the message has been successfully sent (e.g., published to a message queue or acknowledged by an external service), the processing component updates the status of the message in the outbox table to "sent."
6. **Retry Mechanism**: If sending a message fails (e.g., due to network issues, external service downtime), the processing component can implement retry logic to periodically attempt to send the message again. It should also handle failure scenarios, such as moving messages to a "failed" state after a maximum number of retries.

Key Advantages of the Transactional Outbox Pattern:

* **Data Consistency**: The pattern ensures that both data changes and message distribution are transactionally consistent. Either all changes are committed, or none of them are.
* **Message Reliability**: Messages are reliably sent only if the associated database transaction succeeds. This guarantees that no message is lost in transit.
* **Decoupling**: The application's business logic is decoupled from the message distribution process. This allows the application to focus on its core functionality while messages are handled asynchronously.
* **Scalability**: The message processing component can be independently scaled to handle message distribution.
* **Error Handling**: The pattern supports sophisticated error handling and retry mechanisms, enhancing the reliability of message delivery.
