# Parties: Acquirer, Issuer

## **Acquirer** (merchant acquirer or acquiring bank)&#x20;

* \= the financial institution that handles your merchant account so you can accept credit or debit cards.
* roles:
  * **Merchant Accounts Maintenance** - your acquirer will offer and maintain your merchant account, setting rules and requirements and recording and maintaining account activity e.g. deposits and withdrawals.
  * **Authorization requests:** When a customer pays by card, the acquirer receives the information from the card issuer and then forwards any authorization requests.
  * **Settlement:** When the transaction is cleared and processed, the acquirer receives the funds, pays the card issuer the associated interchange fee and deposits the remaining funds into your account.

## **Issuer** (issuing bank)&#x20;

* \= customer facing part of the payment chain and is the bank that issues the credit or debit card.
* members of the card scheme, such as Visa and Mastercard, but they can also operate as both issuer and card scheme as in the case of Amex.
* roles:
  * **Issuing cards:** As their name suggests, an issuer handles card applications and issues users with a payment card.
  * **Running accounts:** They also offer and maintain the debit or credit accounts, setting card spend limits, recording transactions, issuing statements, taking repayments and monitoring for fraud.
  * **Card authorization:** Issuers manage the ID and security processes and authenticate transactions, receiving and sending data to the relevant card schemes and payment gateways to approve or decline cardholder transactions.
  * **Releasing funds:** Once a transaction is approved, the issuer releases the funds to the merchantâ€™s acquiring bank.
  * **Rewards:** Many issuers also allow consumers to earn loyalty points or cashback from purchases made with payment cards.
